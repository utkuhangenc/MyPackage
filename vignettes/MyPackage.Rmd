This project is my first attempt to create a R package and publish it online. It has only two function and one of them is the same function Hillary Parker created in [her tutorial](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) about creating packages in R. 

The other function is a really simple one and takes the square of input value.
